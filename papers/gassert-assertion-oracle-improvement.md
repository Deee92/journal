### [GAssert: A Fully Automated Tool to Improve Assertion Oracles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402475)

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/valerio-terragni/gassert)
- Oracle problem: challenging to determine what the expected output is
- Oracle deficiencies: false positives (assertion fails when it should pass) and false negatives (assertion passes when it should fail)
- Oracle deficiencies identified with a tool called [OASIs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794642)
- However, manually correcting these deficiencies is still very hard
- **This paper**: demonstration of GAssert, Genetic Assertion improvement: novel co-evolutionary algorithm to automatically remove oracle deficiencies identified with OASIs
- **Methodology**: Two populations of assertions evolved in parallel with three competing objectives:
  - minimizing no. of false positives
  - minimizing no. of false negatives
  - minimizing size of assertion (for tie-breaking situations)
- **Evaluation**: initial set of [DAIKON](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/841011)-generated assertions on 34 methods from 7 Java projects
- **Results**: Improved assertions have zero false positives, false negatives reduced by 40%, mutation score increased by 34%

### GAssert
- CLI, five inputs
  - source code of Java class
  - name of method under analysis 
  - initial assertion oracle
  - assertion point - position in method where assertion is placed
  - global, internal time budget for oracle improvement
- Output: improved assertion oracle
- Phases:
  - instrumentation of method to capture runtime state
  - initialization of program state: initial set of correct and incorrect states by running test suite on instrumented original method and instrumented mutated method
  - oracle improvement GAssert and OASIs executed alternatively until time budget expires, or no more oracle deficiencies found by OASIs for improved oracle
  - validation of initial and improved assertions on a validation set of tests and mutations

### Summary
- For a method passed as input, GAssert evolves two populations of assertions (specified by users or invariants generated by Daikon) in parallel, one each for correct and incorrect states of a method in the system.
- The main objective is to minimize assertion deficiencies. These deficiencies are computed by another tool called OASIs, and are represented as false positives (cases where an assertion fails but should pass), and false negatives (cases where an assertion passes but should fail).
- GAssert was evaluated on 34 methods from 7 Java case studies, and was found to improve assertions so that there are no false positives.
- Combines many aspects of test generation and improvement, as well as uses many well-known tools across its various phases, such as EvoSuite, Daikon, Major, Randoop, and PIT.
