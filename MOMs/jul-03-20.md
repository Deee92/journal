Participants: Benoit, Deepika

- checkstyle: testing/code-quality tool, but hard to explain using a tool like this with our tool, a real user-application would be preferable
- Continue working on omitting fields for ttorrent (Reflection)
- Start working with geoserver
- Covered != tested
  - An instruction may be covered by some method (or a chain thereof) executing the instruction, but there might not be a test case directly exercising that instruction
  - An instruction is not covered if no test case exercises it, but even if it is covered, there might not be a test case that directly exercises it 
  - A mutant introduced in this instruction might still go undetected
- https://ponicode.com/
- Generating call graphs for methods (how deep is the method in the call stack) with glowroot (using another tool becomes more complex)
- 20% TA duties: recommendations, contact profs, contact TCS & SCS people-responsible, thesis supervision (~5%)
