Participants: Benoit, Deepika

Create sample programs / applications ~ 10

Develop pure method processor incrementally

Start with finding all methods, then cases for public, private, static, non-static, overloaded, overridden, ...

Run incrementally for sample applications

Write test cases for those - input program and oracle

Ultimately find pure methods for sample applications

Timeline:

Now: infrastructure ready roughly by June

Later: experimental runs with real workload

Even later: Write a first draft

Distant future: Submit
