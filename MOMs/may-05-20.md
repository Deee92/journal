- More criteria added:
  - synchronized blocks
  - methods in @interface

- [jitsi/jitsi-videobridge v2.1](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge/tree/v2.1): 105/893 (11.7%)

- Refactoring with Thomas

- Start building testing infrastructure, eventually use a real application as test resource

- Make tool categorize / tag candidate methods based on:
  - number of statements / instructions
  - whether it has conditionals, switch statements, loops
  - whether it defines, assigns to local variables
  - parameters
  - return types

- Compare between commons-cli, commons-math (or packages thereof), commons-collections, jitsi-videobridge, ttorrent (app | combination\_of\_tags | time)

- More interesting cases for impure methods (e.g., methods that invoke pure methods, or are idempotent)
