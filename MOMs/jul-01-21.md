Participants: Louise, Deepika

- We use [saleor v2.11](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor/tree/2.11) as open-source case study, in addition to Frontapp
  - [All mentions of GraphQL in the saleor docs](https://docs.saleor.io/search?q=graphql)
  - saleor uses Graphene, Python backend for GraphQL - tutorial [here](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-python/0-introduction/)
- AutoGraphQL can now calculate individual and cumulative schema coverage for generated tests
  - A generated report lists the tuples covered and not covered by the generated tests
  - This script can be used for tests generated for both case studies
- **TODO**
  - Louise studies saleor schema to determine metrics like number of types, number of query types, and so on
    - We discuss these metrics when describing both case studies in the paper
  - Louise and Deepika deploy saleor locally and check the [GraphQL queries logged by default, per the docs](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.0/developer/running-saleor/monitoring)
    - If these logs are compatible with AutoGraphQL, we decide if we want to re-implement a middleware with the event listener to log queries for saleor
  - Louise implements middleware to obtain original schema coverage for saleor, plus schema coverage report
  - Deepika writes one section in the paper
  - Louise works on resolving the issues on the [AutoGraphQL repo](https://github.com/louisezetterlund/autographql,)
