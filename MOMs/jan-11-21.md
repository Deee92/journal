- Void methods -> push results somewhere to potentially add to paper revision
- Summaries of papers on mocking:
  - [Assessing Mock Classes: An Empirical Study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9240675)

  - [Mock-object generation with behavior](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4019611)
- Next phase: **Mocking objects**:
  - identify candidates for mocking: pseudo-tested methods for which we generate tests that also invoke methods of other classes
  - 1st step: manually implement mocking for these using a mocking framework ([Mockito](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Mockito/article.html#using-powermock-with-mockito), most likely)
- Website: courses not very relevant, perhaps add a CV, later: a section for talks/presentations
- XML-orchestra: try altering the pitch and not the speed - repitition
- eISP updates
