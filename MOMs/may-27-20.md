- Oscar (Rennes, FR): Descartes, Reneri, pseudo-tested methods, [PhD thesis, Dec '19](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vXN_KYuFGLoIfVK9vQJ4f8nBNFDgSG6l/view)
- Instrumentation options:
  1. [javassist](https://www.javassist.org/) - works at bytecode-level, uses ASM, powers JBoss (AOP)
  2. Spoon - source-code level processing, transformation, instrumentation, templating
  3. [AspectJ](https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/) - AOP
- Another way of finding pure methods also static but based on bytecode instead of source code (compiled, easy to find if assignments or modifications are being made)
- Another way of finding return values is calling the pure method and saving the returned value in a variable, instead of creating new lines of code in the method in question 
- Reconstructing complex objects to generate test cases complex => for private fields etc, reflection => JVM now gives warnings
- In our case, we're currently excluding constructors and method invocations
- Incrementally including more kinds of methods, say idempotent
- If method is pseudo-tested, test cases generated specifically for those, instead of pseudo-tested method being somewhere along the chain of invocation
- i.e. test cases directly assert results from a method invocation
- Some nethods heavily used in production, no unit tests
