- Depth-first: try out more methods from ttorrent with Glowroot + serialization, explore corner cases (multiple parameter objects, etc)
- Identify the context of method invocations, i.e., distinct triples: `<receiving objects, parameter objects, returned objects>` for each invoked method
- Identifying triples can also help with storage
- Also, Glowroot for number of invocations of each method
- Issue with the object with concurrent collections
- Dynamically assigning values to `@Pointcut` variables to automate the instrumentation process can wait
- One round trip => running ttorrent with workload, serializing objects for pure methods, regenerating or recreating them (deserialization) to generate test cases
