- Depth-first: try out more methods from ttorrent with Glowroot + serialization, explore corner cases (multiple parameter objects, etc)
- Identify the context of method invocations, i.e., distinct triples: `<receiving objects, parameter objects, returned objects>` for each invoked method
- Identifying triples can also help with storage
- Also, Glowroot for number of invocations of each method
- Issue with the object with concurrent collections
- Dynamically assigning values to `@Pointcut` variables to automate the instrumentation process can wait
- One round trip => running ttorrent with workload, serializing objects for pure methods, regenerating or recreating them (deserialization) to generate test cases

Issues with XStream: Cases such as `com.turn.ttorrent.network.ConnectionManager.getBindPort()` and `com.turn.ttorrent.client.CommunicationManager.getPeersStorage()`
- https://x-stream.github.io/faq.html#Serialization => possibly the point about using sockets
- https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/101
- `--add-opens java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED`..., not what we need
- Possible fix: exclude these from set of pure methods? Does that comply with our definition?
