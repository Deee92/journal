Participants: Benoit, Martin, Brice, Long, Deepika

- Manually analyze a random sample of 30% to determine amount of repos that are not Java
- New case studies for which we can find workload - from Long's updated list of buildable applications
  - good base images for which we can have a load generator
- `archived:false` would have been useful if we were missing data => archived repos okay for now
