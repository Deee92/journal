- Handling cases where we serialize internal jdk libraries (threads, etc)
  - Do we omit these fields and serialize purely domain object fields
  - Can we run this in a single-thread
- End-to-end testing with a workload
- Method being instrumented and its test case: analyze how developers initialize test objects
- Can we generate objects with the fields that we serialize during monitoring?
- Manual analysis for a few concrete cases
