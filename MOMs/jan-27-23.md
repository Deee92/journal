### Participants: B, D

- production input minimization through mutation
- original serialized production data (preferably JSON)
- mutation of fields within the receiving object
  - extreme mutation (returning default values or null)
  - other mutation operators (+, -, ...)?
- prepare mutated variants (JSON)
- use as inputs in test
- objects may be simpler to start with, not very nested
