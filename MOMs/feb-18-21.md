- do new tests uncover dormant bugs?
- data-driven test design
- how do they test after a fix? how do they determine that the issue is indeed fixed? 
- does it re-occur in production?
- find papers "object protocol testing"
```
int testAMethod() {
  // what we want with mocks - verify the number of times these methods are invoked
  verify(atLeastOnce(), b.someMethod(anyInt(), anyFloat()));
  verify(times(5), b.someMethod(anyInt(), anyFloat()));
}
