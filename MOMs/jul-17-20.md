Participants: Benoit, Deepika

- Server - computing + storage
- Pipeline:
  - pankti finds pure methods
  - We find interesting ones based on criteria
  - Write glowroot plugin
  - Run app with workload and glowroot to serialize objects
  - Profile the invoked methods with async-profiler with the same app workload to get DCG
- We have object data for private methods only, not their public callers down the call stack (except receiving objects) => no E2E tests
- Public callers not pure
- For Monday meeting: For isFullMatch(byte[], int) in org.apache.fontbox.cmap.CodeSpaceRange, identify
  - Unique I/O pairs (unique triples of receiving, parameters, returned objects)
  - Callers
  - Depth
  - Pairs of callers and depths
  - Manually write a test case for discussion and demo
- Find another public case study
- Monday meeting on POBS: Update RW, review, submission early Aug
