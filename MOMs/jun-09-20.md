- [POBS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06914): Reviewers' comments
- Overhead analysis:
  - protocol to measure end-to-end overhead
  - mockserver: used in testing, overhead not relevant
  - openapi-generator: used offline
  - Overhead on an application actually used in prod would be more interesting
- Clarify in technical section how POBS (Glowroot + _TripleAgent_) itself does not mix up observed metrics, see reviewer comments below

1. _The goal of the paper is to add monitoring capabilities to the dockerized applications, however, by adding this functionality to the Dockerfiles itself means that the overhead of the monitoring functionality will be intermingled with the overheads of the monitored application. Therefore, the validity of the direct output of the monitoring such as heap memory usage, the CPU and the network I/O and any application performance specific metrics is questionable._
2. _The performance overhead comparing the original version and the augmented version is not provided in the evaluation section, which is necessary to understand the side effects of the approach itself._

Glowroot overhead:
- [Definition: APM](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/definition/Application-monitoring-app-monitoring)
- [APM on Wikipedia + references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management)
- [What Is Application Performance Monitoring?](https://www.appdynamics.com/product/application-performance-management/application-performance-monitoring/what-is-application-performance-monitoring)
- [5 reasons to avoid agents for application performance management](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2183397/5-reasons-to-avoid-agents-for-application-performance-management.html)
- [Evaluating APM overhead - AppDynamics and NewRelic](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/Evaluating-APM-Overhead/)
  - APM tools instrument code at runtime, so introduce some performance overhead
  - Important to note that APM overhead depends on application, usage, environment (basically context)
  - For modern APM tools, overhead is minimal and negligible
- [The Real Overhead of Managing Application Performance](https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/product/the-real-overhead-of-managing-application-performance/)
  - APM tools need optimal configurations themselves, these can't be done everytime
  - Business transactions - which URLs and requests to call "transactions"
  - Instrumentation - which classes and methods to monitor
  - Thresholds - when to collect data
  - Overhead - how much agent overhead is introduced from data collection
- [APM Best Practices](https://books.google.se/books?id=UHWjgcn3BsQC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=apm+tools+overhead&source=bl&ots=Ebc9yd7Z8O&sig=ACfU3U3JwB08H9ddqWILmo38iV5bQm8N2A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjV5tTs4vTpAhVrposKHTt0ALoQ6AEwD3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=apm%20tools%20overhead&f=false)
  - Can't measure anything without perturbing system
  - Balance overhead with the visibility
  - Availability monitoring: computing platforms - CPU, disk, network, process status
  - Application monitoring: software components and services, relationships between them
  - Application-specific issues
- [Glowroot overhead](https://glowroot.org/overhead.html)
  - Overhead in the microseconds
  - Glowroot itself is fine tuned and microbenchmarked 
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/glowroot/glowroot-benchmark)
- __Conclusion__: APM tools always add some overhead, and the amount of overhead they add is context-specific. However, if configured correctly, the overhead is negligible for modern APM tools such as Glowroot. 

TripleAgent overhead
- Overhead caused by TripleAgent?

- Install docker, compile a buildable application
- Run the application with some workload without POBS
- Run the same application with the same workload with POBS
