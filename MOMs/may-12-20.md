- Jitsi report
- Use Jitsi as test resource, build test suite
- Analyze void pure methods - purpose?
- Next phase: instrumenting pure methods - input parameters, values after computations(, fields) - before and after method execution
- How do we populate fields with data during test generation 
- Ideas for the summer: Empirical analysis of JUnit testing code (Spoon, R / Python) - trends, PBT, mocking, (ecosystem)
