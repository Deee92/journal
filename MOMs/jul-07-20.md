Participants: Benoit, Deepika

- Analysis: extract pure methods, systematically filter out "interesting" methods
  - based on parameters
  - return types
  - how deep they are in the call stack
  - number of invocations
- Manual phase: instrumenting these interesting methods, running application, serializing objects
- Automation: Generating test cases for these methods
- Writing: Approach - what (more important) and how (implementation details - tools used, etc)
- We focus on end-user applications with direct workloads, and not libraries which have clients
