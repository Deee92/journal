Participants: Benoit, Deepika

- Finding a good case study that uses Java + Maven
- The project must not be (util) library but an application with moderately good documentation, and for which we can find a workload
- grobid uses Gradle, pankti uses a MavenLauncher that needs POM to build Spoon model
- graphhopper - annoying exception at boot-up both while running as is and within container
- Omitting fields for objects that are not serialized completely
- Possible case studies: ttorrent, jitsi-videobridge, HedWig, graphhopper
- POBS: Paris marathon route with graphhopper, dblp to download ISSRE'19 papers 
- Dynamic call graphs - how many methods are called before that method is called - how close is the method to the app domain 
- How to DCGs for unit tests and end-to-end tests (with workload) differ - empirically
- Look at papers for dynamic call graphs
- [Improving in-house testing using field execution data](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/62267/WANG-DISSERTATION-2019.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
