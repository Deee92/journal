Participants: Benoit, Deepika

- Add method visibility to dataset
- Filtering intersting methods: public boolean pure methods that accept parameters
  - ttorrent: 6
  - pdfbox: 5
- Profile, analyze different contexts (different callers, depths in call stack)
- For private methods, find public callers
- End-to-end test generation, the oracle can also then be whether the method was called
- By our definition of purity, these methods will be at TOS, they don't call other methods
- Plots: method vs depth in call stack, different contexts + unique parameters (all runtime info)
- POBS: Section IV
- Code generation (Spoon, DSpot) with Benjamin, Benoit
