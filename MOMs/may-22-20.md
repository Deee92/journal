- Turns out there are no void pure methods, no tested app has any
- All but one void methods were modifying [array arguments](https://github.com/Deee92/journal/blob/master/notes/array-arguments.md)
- [One void method](https://github.com/castor-software/pankti/commit/c1ea78abf9a18cda1769a70c8a188cb9478b369c) in commons-math was nested and was modifying an array of its parent
__org/apache/commons/math3/linear/SingularValueDecomposition#getCovariance(double)]#visit(int,int,double)__
  ```
  public RealMatrix getCovariance(final double minSingularValue) {
    // some code
    final double[][] data = new double[dimension][p];
    getVT().walkInOptimizedOrder(new DefaultRealMatrixPreservingVisitor() {
      @Override
      public void visit(final int row, final int column,
                        final double value) {
        data[row][column] = value / singularValues[row];
      }
    }, 0, dimension - 1, 0, p - 1);

    // some code
  }
  ```

- Test cases for jitsi - confirm all numbers, one test case per filter for some coverage
- [Pankti's README](https://github.com/castor-software/pankti) now has definition of purity
- Finish paper notes over the weekend
