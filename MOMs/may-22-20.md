- Turns out there are no void pure methods, no tested app has any
- All but one void methods were modifying [array arguments](https://github.com/Deee92/journal/blob/master/notes/array-arguments.md)
- [One void method](https://github.com/castor-software/pankti/commit/c1ea78abf9a18cda1769a70c8a188cb9478b369c) in commons-math was nested and was modifying an array of its parent
__org/apache/commons/math3/linear/SingularValueDecomposition#getCovariance(double)]#visit(int,int,double)__
  ```
  public RealMatrix getCovariance(final double minSingularValue) {
    // some code
    final double[][] data = new double[dimension][p];
    getVT().walkInOptimizedOrder(new DefaultRealMatrixPreservingVisitor() {
      @Override
      public void visit(final int row, final int column,
                        final double value) {
        data[row][column] = value / singularValues[row];
      }
    }, 0, dimension - 1, 0, p - 1);

    // some code
  }
  ```

- Test cases for jitsi - confirm all numbers, one test case per filter for some coverage
- Add comments and a README [here](https://github.com/castor-software/pankti/tree/master/src/test) to explain the use of jitsi as test resource, maybe include jitsi numbers too 
- [Pankti's README](https://github.com/castor-software/pankti) now has definition of purity
- Writing: elaborate on the criteria, add steps: manual analysis for jitsi, validation with pankti, ...
- Remove column for "returns a value" in [pankti results](https://github.com/Deee92/journal/blob/master/notes/pankti-analysis.md), add "returns an object"
- Add column for LOC, number of modules for applications
- Finish paper notes over the weekend
- Phase two - instrumentation: Spoon processor to add a line of code in the beginning of a pure method to get values of arguments, fields when method is invoked; also a line of code before the return statement to create a local variable whose value is the returned expression (then return that local variable)
- Save (serialize) object containing these values
- Two versions of a program (say ttorrrent) - one without instrumentation and one with - still static, no execution / workload needed upto this point
- This is different from [bytecode instrumentation](https://technoga.wordpress.com/2012/12/01/what-is-bytecode-instrumentation/)
- Another set of test cases to verify that added code is present in instrumented version
