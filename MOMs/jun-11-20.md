- Serialization of the three kinds of objects involved in a method invocation:
  `A returnedObject = B.method(1, true, complexParameterObject)`
  - returned object (`@BindReturn Object returnedObject`)
  - objects passed as parameters (`@BindParameter Object complexParameterObject ?`)
  - receiver objects (`@BindReceiver ??`)
- Goal: Deserialize and assert equality with output of method invocation
- Java Serialization (classes implementing Serializable), Kryo (currently trying out), JBoss serialization
- To save objects as JSON - GSON (weird java/sql/time error), Jackson (try [this](https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-field-serializable-deserializable-or-not))
- Another one for JSON [here](https://www.baeldung.com/java-org-json)
- To save objects as XML - Xstream (trying out now - looks promising)
- Saving objects as JSON can be useful to understand how these objects are different from each other across invocations => may be pictorially represented
- Alternative: Creating a transformed version of the application and implementing Serialization, "testability" before deployment
- Look at different outputs from the invocation of the same method
- POBS: Find a way to test the end-to-end overhead of Glowroot + TripleAgent as compared to a normal run
