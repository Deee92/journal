- A journey into the runtime behaviour of applications as observed by Glowroot (Monitoring) => Empirical analysis + developer surveys
- Empiritcal study || pankti
- Where and how is Glowroot being used - github, blogs, ...
- Instrumentation and tracing for Pankti with Glowroot - out of the box / with tweaks
- Glowroot used in the industry, novel to academia
- Spoon, Javassist, ASM
- Currently Spoon for source code, Javassist for bytecode
- At a later phase, pankti could be made to work at the bytecode level => (pure) methods also from dependencies used in the app
- REFACTOR PANKTI!
