- Current issues with ttorrent: receiving and returned objects sometimes out of order, omitting non-domain fields too deep in the Java API
- For cases that do work, deserialization seems good so far
- Alternative case studies: graphhopper (Maven), grobid (Gradle, not Maven) - might not have network dependencies/constraints like ttorrent
- Collect metadata:
  - number of classes in project
  - number of (pure) methods we extract, instrument
  - number of invocations of these methods
  - instances we could serialize
  - distinct (pairs of) instances we serialize
  - ...
- 2 phases (currently all manual after method extraction)
  - extraction of the methods and their instrumentation, serialization into XML
  - infra setup (adding XStream to project POM), generation of test cases
- Automating the second phase of test case generation (adding dependencies to project POM, using templates, generating assertions, running tests)
- Dynamic call graph:
  - where are these instrumented methods?
  - how high in the project API (project domain) or deep in the infrastructure (Java library) are these instrumented methods
- Overleaf document with a technical section
  - pankti to find pure methods in Java using Spoon
  - Glowroot to develop instrumentation plugin for methods found
  - XStream to serialize receiving, returned, parameter objects into XML
  - generating assertions using deserialized objects, running these tests
- POBS: try Martin's ideas for graphhopper and grobid workload
