## Paper on faking and production data

### Intuition
- Tests that use fake data have an oracle that is generic
- Similar to property based testing or parameteried tests in this respect
- Tests that use fake data may even be considered parameterized tests, since faker produces random fake inputs for the same oracle
- Intentions captured through a generic oracle
- Specializing faking libraries for an application
- Not generating tests, collecting data to plug into tests that have generic oracles

### Question
- How can we leverage production-data + fake data
- Can we inject real data into these test cases as part of the faking
- Do the generic oracles still hold for the real data
- Extending faking libraries with production data

### Prelim investigation
- Clients of java-faker and datafaker
- Journey into the test cases that use fake data
  - How many test cases, how many assertions
