Participants: Benoit, Brice, Long, Deepika

- Perform an initial filtering on the current dataset to check if Java is the dominant language; Use
  - https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-repository-languages API; Example: `curl https://api.github.com/repos/ityouknow/spring-boot-examples/languages`
  - or cloc
- Find alternative study subjects with workload. Initial pass [here](https://github.com/Deee92/journal/blob/master/MOMs/jun-09-20.md)
- Updated repo versions is no issue

Updates:
- Generate GitHub access token like [so](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
- Update `config.py`
- Call to `languages_url` gets number of bytes in code per language
- [Updated script](https://github.com/Deee92/journal/blob/master/data/pobs2.0/extract.py)
- `python3 extract.py` 
- query results and output [here](https://github.com/Deee92/journal/tree/master/data/pobs2.0)
- By default, `language` in search query param returns language with most bytes (`language:Java+language:Dockerfile` is OR)
- Also see `archived:false`
- Possible alternatives:
  - Check that both Java AND Dockerfile are returned by call to `languages_url`
  - Find out number of `.java` files
  - (bytes of Java code / total `size` (KB) of repo)
