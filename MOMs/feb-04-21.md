- AST paper review
  - play to strengths
  - strengths and weaknesses are max 2-3 points, don't have to be sentences
  - elaborate on them in the detailed summary
- Mocks for pankti
  - example: [`testB()`](https://github.com/Deee92/journal/blob/master/notes/mocking-basics.md)
  - Classify methods of interest (statically) as methods that never call external methods from other classes, or call them
  - Intercepting the method call (as Mockito does under the hood)
  - capture return value, arguments passed
  - only invocations that come from method of interest
  - mock will verify number of invocations
  - mock will verify returned value
