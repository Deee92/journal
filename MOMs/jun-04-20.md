- Overview of the instrumentation process (via [JSON-only plugin](https://github.com/Deee92/journal/blob/master/notes/ttorrent.plugin.json)) for some sample pure methods from ttorrent
- `java -javaagent:/home/user/glowroot/glowroot.jar -jar cli/build/ttorrent-cli-1.2-shaded.jar -o ~/Downloads/ ~/Downloads/debian-10.4.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso.torrent`
- Sample results from Glowroot db
  - ` method: getTorrentHash, calling object: LoadedTorrentImpl{piece storage='com.turn.ttorrent.client.storage.PieceStorageImpl@5c20ffa8', metadata provider='com.turn.ttorrent.client.FileMetadataProvider@7fedfe27'}, return value: com.turn.ttorrent.common.ImmutableTorrentHash@2f879bab`
  -  `method: available, calling object: piece# 1-, return value: true`
  -  `method: getBindPort, calling object: com.turn.ttorrent.network.ConnectionManager@6ad5923a, return value: 6881`
- Hashes saved for invoking objects, objects passed as arguments, returned objects
- Find a way to serialize these (maybe using Glowroot's Instrumentation API)
- pankti => set of pure methods, implement the instrumentation plugin for these methods as a separate module
- set of methods + instrumentation for them => running an application with Glowroot as javaagent
- These are good as separate phases, maybe later we replace pankti with some other way of finding methods
- Think of questions for Glowroot community surveys
- Try to generate flamegraph offline from data in Glowroot db
- For each execution with a workload, find out the number of invocations of the instrumented methods
