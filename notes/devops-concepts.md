### DevOps

- AIOps / MLOps
- Ansible (RedHat)
- Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)): on-demand cloud computing platform + API provider
- Amazon Simple Storage Service ([S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)): a part of AWS, scalable object storage through a web service interface (storage for apps, data archives, backup and recovery, ...)
- Azure (Microsoft): cloud service provider (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
- Bazel
- Bots: repairnator, dependabot on GitHub and renovate (maintain db of vulnerable dependencies)
- Burst computing: providing high computing power to handle peak traffic
- Chef
- Cloud computing: on-demand availability of computing/data resources through (mostly Linux) servers
  - using company-owned / on-premise servers and resources ("private" cloud)
  - using servers provided by another company, services delivered over public Internet ("public" cloud)
  - "hybrid" cloud: private cloud (for sensitive data) + public cloud
- Cluster
- Containers (containerization)
- Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Continuous Deployment (CD): pushing to production and releasing to users
- Continuous Integration (CI): configuring automated testing, build tasks to run when new code is added, ensures regression is not introduced
- Cucumber
- DevOps: Development + Operations
- DevSecOps
- Distributed systems: components distributed over several servers (distributed computing)
- Docker: Containerization tool
- Docker compose
- Docker swarm
- Edge computing: providing computing resources close to end-users
- Elastic Compute Cloud ([EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)): a part of AWS, allows users to rent virual computers to run their applications
- GitHub Actions
- GitOps
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): cloud service provider
- Grid computing: using distributed resources for a common goal 
- Headless browsers
- Hypervisor
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): online services that provide APIs to abstract infrastructure details through their data centers (VMs, servers, storage, load balancers, network)
- Jenkins
- Kubernetes (k8s)
- LXC
- Microservice architecture
- Monolithic architecture
- Monorepos
- OpenShift
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Execution runtime, database, web server, development tools
- Puppet
- Rackspace: cloud 
- Selenium
- Serverless: cloud provider manages starting and stopping VMs, good for scalability, optimizes cost
  - Function as a Service (FaaS): using serverless computing, deploying individual functions in the cloud to run in response to events
- Software as a Service (SaaS): CRM, Email, file hosting services, games, virtual desktop communication
- Software Configuration Management (SCM)
- Software suppy chain: all software components that are part of a software product, process
  - build scripts and config files include in-house codebase + 3rd party libraries (dependencies)
  - package managers fetch binaries of external dependencies (code reuse)
  - open-source software supply chain
  - bugs, security vulnerabilities can be included anywhere in the chain, and propagated along the chain
  - typosquatting (gson => Gson)
  - truck factor: number of developers involved
  - reproducible builds
  - depdendency analysis, remove bloated dependencies ([DepClean](https://github.com/castor-software/depclean))
- TeamCity
- Terraform
- Travis CI
- Utility computing: pay-as-you-go, cost reflects amount of resources allocated and consumed
- Version Control System (VCS)
- Virtual machines
- Virtualization: separating a physical device into many "virtual" devices to maximize resource usage, efficiency
- Webhook: user-defined HTTP callbacks triggered by some event (comment on a post, push to a repo to trigger CI, notify bug tracking system, ...)
  - payload is usually JSON
  - HTTP POST request made to the configured URL
